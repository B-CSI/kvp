Installation
============

KVP requires its C **source files to be compiled** to properly install. This is 
**straight forward if you work with Linux or MacOS** machines. It is also 
relatively simple on Windows, if you have some experience with compilers. This 
section describes the available instalation methods. It is recomended to use 
:code:`conda` environments, since they come with :code:`pip` pre-installed.

PyPI
----

The goal is to provide **pre-compiled versions** that can be installed by 
:code:`pip install`, for as many platforms as possible.

.. code-block:: bash
    
    pip install kvp     # In your conda environment of choice

.. admonition:: Supportd platforms
    :class: important
    
    Currently **supported platforms** are:
        
        * :code:`linux_x86_64` - Should be most Linux systems
        * :code:`win_amd64` - Should be most Windows systems
        * :code:`macosx_14_0_x86_64` - Older MacOS systems
        * :code:`macosx_14_0_arm64` - Newer MacOS systems
    
To know if any of the supported platforms includes yours, simply try to install 
the package. If :code:`pip` gives you the package, then it is. If it does not, 
you may try the following section.

From source
-----------

.. _repository: https://github.com/B-CSI/kvp

.. _GNU: https://gcc.gnu.org/install/binaries.html

.. admonition:: Source install
    :class: note
    
    This installation method adds the :code:`-march=native` flag to the 
    compilation process, which might make the low level procedures of the 
    package marginally faster, should one actually care.

Download the `repository`_ and navigate to it from the terminal. Before 
installing, the C sources must be compiled or the package will raise an 
exception at import time.

The **provided makefiles use the GNU C compiler**, which is trivially installed 
in both Linux and MacOS systems, if not readily available after installing the 
operating system.

For **Linux**, simply run the makefile:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    make

.. admonition:: Makefile issues
    :class: error
	
	If this says "nothing to be done for target" or something similar, navigate 
	to the :code:`kvp/src` folder and update any source file by, for example, 
	adding and removing a whitespace. Proper makefiles should not have this 
	issue, but this is not a proper makefile indeed.

For **MacOS**, add the corresponding target so the name of the compiled binary 
is correct for your system:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    make mac

This will create a compiled binary, i.e. a shared library, inside 
:code:`kvp/lib/` called :code:`libkvp-*.so`, where the asterisk is a platform 
specific code.

Once the binary is successfully created, the package can be correctly installed 
with :code:`pip` while in your :code:`conda` environment of choice:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    pip install .

For **Windows**, the process is also trivial if you happen to have the compiler 
installed and on your system PATH. If not, you can try one of the available 
options at the `GNU`_ website.

If you have the compiler, just type:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    make

This will create the compiled binary :code:`libkvp-bill.dll` at the correct 
location. The name is also important, it *has* to be that name.

Now, within your :code:`conda` environment of choice, run :code:`pip`:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    pip install .
